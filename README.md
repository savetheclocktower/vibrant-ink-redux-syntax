# Vibrant Ink Redux

An [Atom][atom] theme. Ported from the original for [TextMate 2][textmate].

Vibrant Ink Redux is based on Justin Palmer's original [Vibrant Ink theme][original]. I've tried to streamline the scope names so that they abide by current TextMate conventions, and I've tweaked some of the styles (and added some new ones) so that they make my eyes happier.

This theme tries to be logical and ordered, except where it isn't. Some of the style rules are the way they are _only_ because they "look right" to me. You should absolutely tweak this to match your _own_ crazy brain.
